DIGITAL LOGIC CIRCUITS

Understand Classical (Boolean digital logic circuits)
    Base conversion (base 2 to base10)
    chain multiple logic gates together in a circuits
    truth tables
    half-adders and full-adders
    memory and counters constructed from gates

BOOLEAN LOGIC GATES 
    NOT (inverter)
    AND  (both inputs are 1)
    NAND (both inputs are not 1)
    OR (either input is 1: or both are 1)
    XOR (either input is 1- EXCLUSIVE (both cannot be 1))
    NOR (neither input is 1)

    OR is a "sum" (A + B), AND is a "multiply" (A * B)
    A NAND gate is equivalent to an inversion followed by an OR
    a NOR gate is equivalent to an inversion followed by an AND 

    AND = 3 NOTs and 1 OR
    OR = 3 NOTs and 1 AND

    Gates have 1 or 2 input lines and 1 output lines
        Input/output lines are either:
            False, F, Cold, Low, L, 0
            True, T, Hot, High, H, 1
    The left side of a truth table is counted using base 2 to ensure that every possible permutation 
    of input states is evaluated across the entire circuit

    Circuits flow (propagate state) from "Left to Right"
        The output of one gate flows into the inputs of the next gates
        We can evaluate a gate's output line only when we know the value for every input line entering that gate
