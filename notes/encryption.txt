INFORMATION THEORY

Textual data in Python is handled with str objects
A Python string is just an array of integers representing Unicode characters
Python does not have character type- a character is just a string with length 1
A Python string is a sequence type- individual elements can be directly accessed using []

ASCII: American Standard Code for Information Interchange
    Most common legacy International standard used across the Internet until 2007
    Has been surpassed by UTF-8 in recent years
        UTF-8 includes ASCII as a subset
    8-bit, one byte character encoding scheme
    Maps most of the characters of Western languages descending from Latin to a specific int value
    1:1 correspondence between a letter and a number
    Every character is always one byte long 
    A file on disk is essentially just a byte array 
        A byte is an 8-bit unsigned integer
        Immutable (read only) once you create it
    We can declare a byte array and load it with the contents of a file
        Often called a buffer
        Use the normal [] operator on a bytes object (immutable) or a byte array (mutable)

Unicode: encoding scheme that can capture every known letter in every known language.. including emojis and greek symbols
    Much larger mapping than ASCII
    Maps every symbol to a code point (a 16 to 21 bit integer)

UTF-8: encodes Unicode with code points
    Encoding standard used for electronic communication
    Defined by the Unicode standard UTF-8 is capable of encoding all valid Unicode code points using one to 4 one byte code units
    Dominant encoding for the world-wide-web

Caesar Shift Cipher
    Simple but effective (for its time)
    Shift original letters forward or backward a given number of letters in the alphabet
    How do we figure out what shift value was used?
        Brute force - ineffective
        We can conduct a histogram analysis to search for recurring symbols
            In english, 'e' is the most common letter... this can help us find the key values (e is 101)

Bigram analysis
    Most Latin languages have a unique fingerprint from their most frequent bigrams (two letter pairs)
    In English, the bigrams TH and HE occur most Often
    All languages have definite articles like these but each language spells theirs differently
        This helps establish a distinct statistical profile for each language
    Linguists and statisticians have compiled lists of the most frequent bigrams per language

Different shift values used for each letter:
    Even if we are unable to break the encryption, can we tell what language was used?
