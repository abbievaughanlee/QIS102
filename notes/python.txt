PYTHON
python's built in functions: https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html
python data types: 
    numbers: int, float, complex
    bool
    set {2, 4, 6}
    dict {1:'a', 2:'b'}
    sequence
        str
        list [2, '1', 5.7] ORDER IS NOT FIXED
        tuple (3, 4.5, 'b') ORDER IS FIXED
identifiers- names
    use_snake_case
f string: print(f"I am {age_years} years old", end = ",")
    {} replacement field (substituting values into replacement fields is called string interpolation)
    formatter:
        :< left aligns the result
        :> right aligns the result
        :^ center aligns the result:, uses a comma as a thousand separator
        :f fix point number format
        :n number format
        :% percentage format
style guide (PEP 8) : https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/
numpy guide: https://numpy.org/
numpy arrays:
    an array is a set of elements having all the same type
    size() returns the length of an array
    np.arange(1, 10, 1.5)
        creates an array from a range
        of the format (start, end, step)
        end is not inclusive
numpy vectorized operations
    a vectorized scalar operation applies a function to every element in a single array
    a vectorized array operation applies a function to elements inboth arrays that have the same index value
Statements and Scopes
    statement does something (sentence)
        either a declaration, a keyword, or a function
        statements are executed from top to bottom of a scope 
    scope contains one or more statements (paragraph)
        a scope in python begins with a colon
        scopes are also denoted via indentation
        all the statements in a scope must start at the same column
        scopes can be nested (each inner scope is further indented)
    a for loop introduces a scope with a colon
    an if statement inside of a for loop is an example of a nested statement inside a scope
Defining a function
    def totient(n):
        s = 1
        for i in range(2, n):
            if np.gcd(i, n) == 1:
                s += 1
        return s
    most important function is called main()
For loops
    executes all the statements within its scope for each number within a given range
    common to use the range() function to create the array of numbers passed into the for statement
if statement
    identifies which code block to run based upon the value of a boolean expression
while loop: executes all the statements within its scope as long as the loop conditional remains true
np.where returns an array of index numbers
    factors = x[np.where(n % x == 0)]
    the index numbers in the array x where n % x == 0.
