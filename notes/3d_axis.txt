3D AXES IN MATPLOTLIB
Two ways:
1. Define a set of 3d vertices and then manually group these vertices into facets
    This approach gives maximal rendering control but is slower
    Leverages the capabilities of Poly3DCollection
2. Provide three arrays containing the x, y, z vertices and then let matplotlib determine how to best connect them
    No lines connecting the points = scatter plot 
    Only lines connecting the points - wireframe
    Filled polygons connecting nearby points = surface plot
