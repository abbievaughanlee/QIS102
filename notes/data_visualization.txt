np.linspace(): creates linear spaces (array)
    creates a linearly spaced array: inclusive

vectorized operations that implicitly operate on an entire NumPy array
note: Qt- software that helps create graphical user interfaces
Dunder = double underscore
    dunder variables and dunder methods
in addition to numerical analysis, Python has packages that offer computer algebra systems
    this allows us to define functions using higher level mathematical sumbols and then has Python provide exact solutions
    sympy
Polar Coordinates
