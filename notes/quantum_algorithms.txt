QUANTUM ALGORITHMS 

Deutsch algorithm:
    You are the "traveler" and you prepare two qubits in whatever state you wish
    You approach the "oracle" and present your two qubits
    The oracle applies one of four possible secret functions to the two qubits and returns them
    You are free to do what you want with the qubits afterward, but at some point you must measure
    one (and only one) of the qubits
    Based on the single measurement, you must tell the oracle which of the four functions he applied
    The four functions:
        NOP - q0 qubit is not changed at all (balanced)
        Always 0: q0 qubit is set to the zero state (constant)
        Always 1: q0 is set to the one state (constant)
        NOT: q0 is inverted with an X gate (balanced)
    
    We shall call a function f: {0, 1}**(n) -> {0, 1} balanced if exactly half of the inputs go to 0
    and the other half go to 1. Call a function constant if all inputs go to 0 or all go to 1

    The Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm solves the following problem: Suppose you are given a function which you 
    can evaluate but cannot "see" the way it is defined. Suppose further that you are assured the 
    function is either balanced or constant. Determine if it is balanced or constant

    Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm demonstrates quantum supremacy because no classical computer can outperform
    this quantum circuit (does not prove it!!)

    With four possible secret functions, one might assume that two trips to the oracle would be required
    to prove beyond any doubt which function was applied...
        Deutsch changes the basis so we can answer the question with just one trip

Superdense coding is a quantum communication protocol that allows transmitting two classical bits using 
only a single qubit as the carrier
Consequentially, superdense coding doubles the efficiency of classical information transmission
compared to traditional methods where one qubit carries only one classical bit
Superdense coding can be combined with other quantum protocols such as quantum key distribution to improve
security
