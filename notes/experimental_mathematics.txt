Square roots
    newtons method for calculating the square root of any real x involves keeping track of low end and high end brackets which get successively closer to the actual root.
    we start with lowEnd = 0 and highEnd = x
    the process brackets inward keeping lowEnd^2 <= x <= highEnd^2
    during each loop iteration, our estimate is the mean of the current lowEnd and highEnd brackets
Several Python packages allow us to deal with different data
    a good package to use for large numbers is mpmath
        use when you need extreme precision: not better than numpy otherwise
