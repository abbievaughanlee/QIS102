ALGORITHMIC EFFICIENCY
A list is a set of elements that can have varying types
    Individual elements in a list are accessed by using their index number []
    len() returns the length of the list
For any vectorized operations or heterogeneous storage, use a numpy array.
Instrumenting your code- the process of taking accurate timings of the runtime performance of key algorithms within the program
    Python provides a time object that can measure the current CPU time of a running process to the nearest millisecond
    We bracket the code under analysis by measuring the clock immediately before the start and again after the algorithm to calculate the elapsed time
We measure algorithmic efficiency by estimating the impact on the total run time as the size of                   h data increases
We are only interested in the principal (highest exponent) term which describes the overall order of the algorithm
The order of the algorithm is expressed in Big O notation
Optimal algorithms have the smallest possible order

Quicksort: uses divide and conquer strategy to overcome the problems of bubble sort

Timsort: hybrid, stable sorting algorithm
    derived from merge sort and insertion sort
    merges runs until criteria is fulfilled

fn fact: there exists a sorting algorithm on quantum computers that is O(n) (Linear!!)
